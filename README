Features:
	Correctly sets up Initialization Vectors!
	Prints stuff to the screen!
	Initializes hardware with inline assembly!
	Connects with GDB!
	Has Makefile!
	A full:
		1k of stack space!
		1k of kernel space!
		2k of program space!
		8k of dynamic memory!

Before Use:
	- Compile CECS-525-QEMU
		+ Written by Tyler Hall
		+ http://bit.ly/r7tiCq
		+ TODO: Add instructions
	
	- Modify Makefile to point to your cross compiler toolchain and qemu
          instance.
		+ Recommended toolchain is the cross-m68k-elf-{gcc,binutils,gdb}
		  in the AUR
		+ http://bit.ly/oT8Hnw
		+ Requires Arch Linux.

To Use:
	- Launch a qemu instance waiting for gdb to attach:
		$ make debug
	  Then, in a new terminal:
		$ ./run_gdb

	- Launch program:
		$ make run

    - This will launch an instance of QEMU.  To exit the qemu session type:
        $ 'Ctrl-A' then 'C' to bring up the qemu console
            * keep in mind your OS is still running in the background
        $ quit to exit

	  Can still attach gdb if you make it in time with:
		$ ./run_gdb

	- Just compile:
		$ make

	- Get dissassembly:
		$ make dissassemble

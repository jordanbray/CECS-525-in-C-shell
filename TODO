implement rest of MMONITOR, in particular:
	- fill in the __asm_getch__ shell in assembly.c
	- fix whatever bugs that creates in getch in screen.c
	- copy/paste a proper malloc/free/realloc from somewhere.
		+ If i remember correctly, they're all over the place...
		+ We may need to search for a kalloc or kmalloc for kernel
		  memory allocation.

Maybe search for a full simple c library.
	- Jimmy said something about newlib as a c library.  To implement it
	  (or any other c library), we have to provide it with the following
	  functions.  We will need some sort of in-memory filesystem.
		* There are 18 needed functions.
		* They are defined in needed_for_libc.h
		* They don't need to be fully functional, just enough to trick
		  * the library into running.
		* We should decide if we want to implement them or not.
		* To look at what the standard requires from each of these, go
		  here: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm

make CECS-525-QEMU stop on the STOP {argument} instruction.
	- I have no idea how to do this.

probably finish the lab at some point...
	- Also finish up this section...

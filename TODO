implement rest of MMONITOR, in particular:
	- fill in the __asm_getch__ shell in assembly.c
	- fix whatever bugs that creates in getch in screen.c
	- copy/paste a proper malloc/free/realloc from somewhere.
		+ If i remember correctly, they're all over the place...
		+ We may need to search for a kalloc or kmalloc for kernel
		  memory allocation.
		+ Maybe search for a full simple c library.
			* Jimmy said something about something like this
			  existing.
		+ Implement the exception vector stuffs
	- 

make CECS-525-QEMU stop on the STOP {argument} instruction.
	- I have no idea how to do this.

probably finish the lab at some point...
	- Also finish up this section...
